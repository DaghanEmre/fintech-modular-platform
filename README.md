# FinTech Modular Platform

A **living and evolving FinTech platform** built with **Java** to experiment with **microservices, concurrency, event-driven architecture, and modern enterprise patterns** over time.

This repository is designed as a **long-term learning and experimentation space**, reflecting how Java-based financial systems evolve in real-world enterprise environments.

---

## 🎯 Project Vision

The main goal of this project is to:

- Continuously improve **Java backend engineering skills**
- Explore **real-world FinTech problems** such as payments, concurrency, consistency, and integrations
- Build a **modular, extensible, and production-oriented architecture**
- Experience the **evolution of Java** (classic blocking → async → event-driven → modern Java features)

This is **not a tutorial project**.  
It is intentionally designed to **change, refactor, and evolve** over time.

---

## 🏦 Why FinTech?

FinTech systems naturally introduce complex engineering challenges:

- High concurrency and parallel transactions
- Consistency vs availability trade-offs
- Event-driven workflows
- Integration with legacy systems (SOAP) and modern APIs (REST)
- Observability, auditing, and traceability requirements

The financial domain provides a **realistic and future-proof playground** for advanced Java backend development.

---

## ☕ Why Java?

Java remains one of the most dominant languages in enterprise and financial systems.

This project aims to:
- Leverage **classic enterprise Java patterns**
- Experiment with **modern Java features** (Java 21+, Virtual Threads, Structured Concurrency)
- Compare **blocking, reactive, and event-driven** approaches
- Apply Java in **high-throughput and distributed environments**

---

## 🧱 High-Level Architecture

The platform follows a **microservice-based, event-driven architecture**.

Planned core services include:

- **Customer Service** – customer and identity management
- **Payment Service** – money transfers, transaction processing, concurrency handling
- **Open Banking Adapter** – REST & SOAP integrations with external banking APIs
- **Fraud & Risk Service** – rule-based risk scoring and analysis
- **Notification Service** – asynchronous messaging and notifications
- **Reporting & Audit Service** – immutable audit logs and reporting views

Services communicate using:
- REST APIs for synchronous interactions
- Messaging (Kafka / RabbitMQ) for asynchronous workflows

---

## 🔄 Evolution Over Time

This repository is intentionally **designed to evolve**.

You may find:
- Architectural decisions being revisited
- Refactoring between different approaches
- Multiple implementations of the same concept
- Experimental branches for new Java features

This reflects how **real enterprise systems grow and adapt**.

---

## 🛠️ Planned Technology Stack

Technologies will be introduced **incrementally**, not all at once.

- Java 21+
- Spring Boot & Spring Cloud
- Maven / Gradle
- Oracle / IBM Db2 (conceptual & local setups)
- Kafka / RabbitMQ
- MapStruct
- Spring Cloud Config
- Distributed tracing & logging (OpenTelemetry, Graylog, etc.)
- Docker & Cloud-ready design (AWS-compatible)

## Local Build

This project requires **Java 21**. The root Maven build enforces this baseline.

```bash
mvn clean compile
mvn test
mvn verify
```

## 📚 Documentation

Additional documentation can be found under the `docs/` directory:

- `architecture-vision.md` – architectural principles and decisions
- `roadmap.md` – step-by-step development roadmap
- Future ADRs (Architecture Decision Records)

---

## 🚧 Disclaimer

This project is for **educational and experimental purposes**.

It is not intended for direct production use, but it follows **production-grade design principles** wherever possible.

---

## 📈 Long-Term Goal

To maintain this repository as a **living portfolio**, demonstrating:

- Strong Java fundamentals
- Advanced backend engineering skills
- Distributed systems thinking
- Clean architecture and design decisions
- Declarative domain rules via Specification Pattern
- Metrics-first observability strategy
- Continuous learning mindset
